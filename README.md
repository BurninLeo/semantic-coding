# semantic-coding

The Semantic Coding project initiated at the LMU Munich (Department of Communication) aims to establish a common data format for texts (in the broader sense) that captures the meaning (semantic) of the texts while abstracting from the actual text. The project has several goals:

* Disentangle two processes in communications' content analysis: (a) encoding the meaning and (b) extracting characteristics of texts.
* Allow re-use of encoded texts for subsequent reserach (secondary data analyses)
* Allow for replication of content analysis resarch

The format is also intended to provide a more general format for contents that is independent from languages, and may prove fruitful for applications far beyond communications.
